# Graphics

Hex Map was originally made before SRPs existed, so it used what is now known as the Built-in RP. Starting at version 2.0.0 it uses URP.

The initial conversion from Built-in to URP translated the surface shaders verbatim to shader graphs with custom function nodes, keeping the changes to a minimum. This is the starting point from which the URP shaders can be improved in the future.
